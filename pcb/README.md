## Manufacturing
I used JLCPCB.com to get this manufactured.  They have [a good tutorial](https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/149-how-to-generate-gerber-and-drill-files-in-kicad) on how to generate the Gerber files from KiCad. If the website is not able to calculate the dimensions, you can enter it in manually.  Here are the details

- Size: 364.4 mm x 167.2 mm
- Thickness: 1.6 mm FR4
- 2 Layers
